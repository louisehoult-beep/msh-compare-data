"""Build the per-speciality slice that feeds the two new tabs on a speciality page.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 07/09/2026 the "Suppliers, frameworks & related" tab on every
speciality page was three links out — Supplier Directory, Framework Hub, Compare tab —
and a list of neighbouring specialities. A rep on the wound care page got no wound care
frameworks, no wound care suppliers, no wound care tenders. Lou's instruction, 07/09/2026:
the sections have to be FILTERED to the speciality, and suppliers get their own tab.

WHAT IT PRODUCES. data/speciality-panels/<slug>.json — one small file per speciality,
holding only that speciality's slice of frameworks, suppliers, awards, tenders and the
Drug Tariff. Small on purpose: the page must not pull 13MB of Drug Tariff or 6MB of
supplier index to render a panel.

THE EVIDENCE FLOOR (root rule 14). A speciality with no rule in SPECIALITY_RULES gets
NO panel — it is written with `defined: false` and the renderer shows an honest empty
state. It never falls back to a loose keyword guess, because that is exactly what the
existing tender-history `spec` field does and it is wrong more often than it is right:
of the 16 rows it tags tissue-viability-and-wound-care, 10 are false positives matched
on "tissue", "viability", "pressure" or "compression" — Kew Gardens' seed viability
X-ray cabinet, donated corneal eye tissue, Paper Hygiene and Toilet Tissue, a chest
compression system, a high pressure test rig. None of those may reach a paying member.

Every rule this script applies is written into the file it produces, so a reader can
judge the filter for themselves (rule 14a). test_speciality_panels.py holds the
invariants that fail if the matching breaks (rule 14b).
